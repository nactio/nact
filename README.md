## Nact is redux but for the server

Servers today are very different from those even 10 years ago. So why are we still programming like it's the 90s?

Inspired by the approaches taken by Akka and Erlang, Nact is an open source Node.js framework which enables you to take control of your state to:
         
- more effectively use memory
- improve application resiliance
- increase performance
- reduce coupling 

With out of the box support for event sourcing, and a considered implementation of the actor model, nact can work across a wide variety of domains.

Nact is no silver bullet, but it is evolving to tackle ever more demanding use cases. Perhaps one of them is yours?

To get started, head to https://nact.xyz

> Note: Nact currently only able to work on Node 8 and above.

### A note on regularity of commits
Nact sees daily usage by the project maintainer. The project is extremely stable and has been around for a few years. As the project made the deliberate choice to minimise dependencies, particularly runtime dependencies, there is not a huge need for updates to the project, besides for the occasional introduction of new features. This means that it can be a few months since the last commit. This does not mean the project is dead, but rather that it is working as designed.  

## How are you using Nact?
We would love to hear how you're using Nact. If you'd like to send feedback (bad or good) please email Natalie Cuthbert at github@ncthbrt.com or join the [Discord](https://nact.xyz/en_uk/community).
